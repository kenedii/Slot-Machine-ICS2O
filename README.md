# Slot-Machine-ICS2O
A text based slot machine game in Python that rolls the slots with different odds for each. The user starts out with $100 and spends $5 per roll. There is a very small chance of winning the jackpot of $1 million (increases by $1.5 each roll, $3.5 goes to the house).
Odds are set so the house still wins in the end, but maybe you'll get lucky.

Made for 2020 ICS2O culminating assignment.
